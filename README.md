# About
This is a program, that is meant to annoy you when you accidentally type 'dc' instead of 'cd'.
I got this idea from the man, the myth and the legend [Toyoda Masashi](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl).

# Instalation
```
git clone https://github.com/ondrejhonus/dc.git

cd dc

make dc
```
### edit your rcfile 
```vim ~/.bashrc``` or ```vim ~/.zshrc``` (depending on your shell)

### add a new line: 
```
alias gitup='/path/to/dc/dc'
```

#### Restart your terminal and you should be able to type ```dc``` to annoy yourself when mistyping... Why would you even do this shit? Why am I doing this shit? smh.

# Usage
- Type ```dc``` into your terminal and watch the mayhem
