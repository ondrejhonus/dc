# About
This is a program, that is meant to annoy you when you accidentally type 'dc' instead of 'cd'.
I got this idea from the man, the myth and the legend [Toyoda Masashi](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl).

# Instalation
```
git clone https://github.com/ondrejhonus/dc.git

cd dc

sudo make install
```

# Usage
- Type ```dc``` into your terminal and watch the mayhem
